                <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h3>
    
                     <p>The tools that were selected were fit for purpose and enabled me to carry out all of the tasks. For instance Visual Studio Code has a lot of effective shortcuts and readability and Trello enables you to track all of your tasks from start to completion. However, in the future I would execute research into alternative IT tools to ensure the most effective ones had been selected.

                         For example other code writing software exists such as:  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                    <ul>
                                <li>Sublime Text </li>
