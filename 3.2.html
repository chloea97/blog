                <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
                    </h3>
    
                     <p>
                            Productivity and efficiency are important within any project. It is therefore important to reflect on how to improve them before during and after any digital project. 
<br>
<br>
                            Productivity and efficiency can be affected in a number of ways. These can include; distractions, effectiveness of IT tools, level of planning and level of knowledge.
                            Whilst some of the aspects are controllable such as level of planning, it can be hard within a project to predict obstacles that have arisen through a lack of knowledge, it is also hard to determine how quickly you can pass these obstacles. 
<br>
<br>
                            In order to improve productivity and efficiency it is important to formulate an effective plan and factor in time for variables that may arise.
