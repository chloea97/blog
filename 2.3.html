                     <p>Throughout the build of the website there were a number of obstacles to building the exact design desired. Some of these were overcome through research, including:
            
                    <ul>
                                <li>Use of columns</li>
                                <li>Width and length of images </li>
                    </ul>     

    
                   Others were more complex and I did not have time to execute them properly:


                    <ul>
                                <li>Making the website mobile friendly </li>
                                <li>Effective spacing ‘< br >’ was used as a substitute </li>
                                <li>Aligning text underneath a picture </li>
                    </ul>    
                 <br>
                    Overall given the time constraints and the level of improvement from no knowledge I am happy with my website. I look forward to broadening my knowledge and implementing new pieces of code into my work.
