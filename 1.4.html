            <p>
                    Digital projects largely fail due to lack of formal organisation. Not considering elements or obstacles within projects can lead to huge setbacks further down the line. An example of this is starting to build a website before properly considering the final result.

                        <br>
                    Particularly in time sensitive projects these setbacks could result in missing deadlines which will result it let down colleagues, clients or employers.
