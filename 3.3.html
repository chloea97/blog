                <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects </h3>
    
                     <p>It is important before developing solutions to identify key problems. Problems have included;


                    <ol>
                                <li>Time taken to write content  </li>
                                <li>Lack of knowledge  </li>
                                <li>Length of time taken to write specific code </li>
                    </ol>     
                    Solutions to these problems could therefore be;
                    <ol>
                                <li>Split content within a team of people to improve efficiency, reduce distractions by finding `a quiet place to work and plan the content to be written effectively 
                                    </li>
                                <li>Lack of knowledge can be somewhat resolved through us of different IT tools, such as online tutorials. It can be further helped through bouncing ideas off other members of the group in order to find the best solution </li>
                                <li>Time taken to write code is to some extent just part of executing a digital project. Despite this, being clever with repeating code will enable you to reduce time spent and therefore increase efficiency 
                                    </li>
                             
                    </ol>     
                                
                     </p>
