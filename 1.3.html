            <p>
                    As aforementioned, planning is the most important consideration for any digital project. There are a number of platforms that assist project planning and management each with respective advantages and disadvantages. <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> is a common management tool for small groups or individual projects.

                    <br>
                    Whilst it enables you to track individual tasks through a process, it does not allow you to assign deadlines to tasks which is a key part of time management. It is therefore key when using <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> to either use a separate tool or be extremely mindful of any time constraints within the project.
