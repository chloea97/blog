                <h3>1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page </h3>
    
                     <p>Whilst all of the pages follow the same basic layout, with most of the features overlapping such as tab bar, references, main image and title, as each page has a different function other features differ. As mentioned, individual pages require different content and execute different functions as they have different purposes within the user journey.The key pages on the website include; Home, About Me, Blog and Individual Blog pages.
<br>
<br>
                        Home page
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is considered good UX practise to include a link to have references to all of the key pages on the website on the Home page. I therefore included links to both the blog and the about me pages, before including recommendations for individual blog pages. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        About me
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The about me page was relatively simple to layout as there wasnâ€™t a lot of content to include. It therefore followed a plain title and text format. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Blog
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The blog page had a different layout to all of the other pages. It was split firstly by Unit one and Unit two for readability. Further to this, each post was organised into columns and rows with an image and the post title visible. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Individual pages
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In a similar way to the about me section, these pages followed a typical title and text formal. Some included lists where required. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
