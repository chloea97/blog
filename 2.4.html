                     <p>
                        
Further improvements to my project would include adding functionality such as mobile friendliness and alignment of all of the elements on the pages. I would also include a standardised header and footer to the page that sat inside differently formatted boxes as is typical of a normal website.

Other improvements could include an element of interactivity on the website such as when you hover over the pictures, the title appears on a transparent background. Further to this, I would have the recommended blog posts on the home page to alternate.
