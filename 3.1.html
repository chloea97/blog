                <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
    
                     <p>
                         
As aforementioned the following are the IT tools used within this project, they have been assessed based on their productivity and efficiency within this project. 
<br>
<br>
Trello
<br>
<br>
Trello enables the use of the Kanban method to organize tasks from start through to completion within a task. The drawback of Trello is the inability to set date restrictions on tasks, making it harder to ensure the project stays on track with a timeline.  
<br>
<br>
GitHub
<br>
<br>
GitHub is extremely effective for collaboration and version control. Through controlling versions it reduces risk within the project of lost work. This therefore avoids major setbacks and by default improves efficiency. Drawbacks of GitHub include ability to edit within the tool. 
<br>
<br>
Visual Studio Code
<br>
<br>
Visual Studio Code allows for improved efficiency through smart tools such as finishing off lines of code and readability. Efficiency could be improved through having a live area that updates the finished product as the code is written.
