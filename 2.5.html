                     <p>
                            There were a number of requirements to follow within this project. Some needed to be considered before the build started, such as preparing appropriate content for the website and organising and combining information needed for the website. I executed this effectively and left it prepared in google docs before building as it has the ability to do spelling and grammar checks on the content before pasting it into Visual Studio Code.

                            Other outcomes needed to be considered at the end of the build including checking all of the pages were without errors. This is important as it can impact the functionality of the website. I have executed QA testing throughout the website to ensure no user journeys are interrupted and the code is functioning as desired.
