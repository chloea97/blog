                <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h3>
    
                     <p>
                            There would be a number of factors to consider when assessing the effectiveness of new digital solutions. These include; speed, quality of final product, ease of use and cost, amongst others. 
<br>
<br>
                            Ways to test these outcomes include; executing research into other people’s experiences with a range of tools. This will enable you to have a general overview of the benefits and drawbacks of each of the tools. Despite this, the only way to be sure that they are the most efficient tools for you is to test them yourself as the UI’s make be easier or more difficult for you to use than others. 
                            <br>
<br>
                            The most time effective way to determine the best tools for use is to research all of the options, before narrowing it down to a few that sound the most useful. From this you can personally test each on to find your favourite tool.
