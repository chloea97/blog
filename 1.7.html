                <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects - How does GDPR impact digital projects?
                    </h3>
    
                     <p>There are a number of ways in which legal guidelines affect digital projects.The most recent and important of which is GDPR. Here are a few key ways in which it impacts a website project:
                    <ul>
                                <li>All communications must be opted into - Forms must have an option to not be contacted by the organisation or any third party organisations [1] </li>
                                <li>After accepting online payment, any personal details must be removed after a reasonable period [1] </li>
                                <li>Have a privacy policy that outlines what data you are collecting and why [2] </li>
                                <li>Must give the opportunity to opt out of collection of cookies on first visit to a website [2]</li>
                    </ul>   
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Another key piece of legislation that needs to be followed is the Companies Act, which requires companies to disclose the following information on their website: 
                    <ul>
                                <li>Company name  </li>
                                <li>Company registered number </li>
                                <li>Place of registration, such as England and Wales </li>
                                <li>Registered office address </li>
                                <li>Your company name, postal address and company email address</li>
                                <li>How to contact your business via non-electronic means</li>
                                <li>Your VAT number, even if the website is not being used for e-commerce transactions </li>
                                <li>The name of any trade bodies or professional associations that the business is part of, including membership or registration details [3]</li>
                    </ul>      
                     </p>
