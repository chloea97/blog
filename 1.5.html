            <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </h3>
    
    <p>
            When selecting specific IT systems or software it is first important to research their capabilities, benefits and drawbacks. When you have a comprehensive understanding of what all of the options are and how they work you should next consider what you need if for, what your limitations are (e.g. cost, time) and what the end user needs most from what you are developing. 
        <br>
        <br>

        The final and potentially most difficult step is aligning these to figure out which of the software options will create the best result for your project. Whilst your chosen platform may not allow everything you require, it is better to find out early within the project what compromises you are willing to make as opposed to weeks in having to change systems causing delays in the project timeline.
