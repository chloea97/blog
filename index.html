    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>My experience lies in marketing, with a key focus on digital. With a degree in Marketing and Advertising Management I began my career at a city centre digital design agency in Manchester. Through working closely with clients and the digital time I soon realised I had a keen eye for UX and design.
        
        As many do, I decided I wanted to work for myself and am therefore in the process of starting up my own website design and development business.

    <p>I signed up for Code Nation in order to give myself a strong platform for website development from which to build on, further diversifying the range of services I am able to offer clients. </p>
